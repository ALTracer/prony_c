Prony method detects complex exponents (frequency-domain)
in an input signal (time-domain) using least-square fitting.
The method is superior to Fourier filtering in some ways.

This C implementation relies on LAPACK/BLAS library and tclague.

Written in 2021 for my Master's Thesis.
Intended to run as a PSCAD module for on-line (low-)frequency scanning.
